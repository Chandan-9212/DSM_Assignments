In general, normal (symmetrical) distributions are preferred in statistical analysis, but sometimes skewed distributions are unavoidable.\n",

    "In this dataset, there is one outlier value of 30, which is much lower than the rest of the scores. This outlier can have a significant impact on the measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",

    "Mean: The mean of this dataset is (85 + 78 + 82 + 91 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 88 + 84 + 30) / 10 = 82.4. However, if we remove the outlier value of 30, the mean becomes (85 + 78 + 82 + 91 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 88 + 84) / 9 = 85.22. The presence of the outlier has shifted the mean downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median of this dataset is 86.5, which is relatively unaffected by the outlier value of 30.\n",

    "Range: The range of this dataset is 61 (from 30 to 91), which is heavily influenced by the outlier value of 30.\n",

    "Variance and standard deviation: The presence of the outlier can also increase the variance and standard deviation of the dataset, since the outlier is a significant distance away from the rest of the values.\n",

    "In summary, outliers can have a significant impact on both measures of central tendency and dispersion. It is important to identify and understand the impact of outliers in a dataset before interpreting the summary statistics.\n",
