    "Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics involve the collection, analysis, and presentation of data in order to describe and summarize it in a meaningful way. Descriptive statistics can be used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in data.\n",
    "Example: A business owner may use descriptive statistics to analyze sales data from the past year in order to identify which products are the most popular, which days of the week see the most sales, and which regions have the highest sales volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics involve making inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses, make predictions, and draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.\n",
    "Example: A medical researcher may use inferential statistics to test whether a new drug is effective at reducing the symptoms of a particular disease. They would conduct a randomized controlled trial, collect data from a sample of patients who have the disease, and use inferential statistics to determine whether the drug is more effective than a placebo.\n",

    "Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it determines the type of statistical analysis that can be used and the interpretation of the results. Different statistical tests and techniques are appropriate for different levels of measurement, and using the wrong type of analysis can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a study that collects data on the hair color of participants and their blood pressure. Hair color is a nominal variable, while blood pressure is an interval variable. If a researcher wants to test whether there is a relationship between hair color and blood pressure, they cannot use a test that is designed for interval data, such as correlation or regression analysis. Instead, they would need to use a test that is appropriate for nominal data, such as a chi-square test or a contingency table analysis.\n",
