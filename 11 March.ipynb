    "The margin of error in a confidence interval is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with the estimate of the population parameter. It represents the range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence. In other words, it is the distance between the point estimate (e.g., sample mean) and the upper or lower limit of the confidence interval.\n",

    "The margin of error depends on several factors, including the sample size, the level of confidence, and the variability in the data. Generally, a larger sample size leads to a smaller margin of error, while a smaller sample size leads to a larger margin of error. This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the population and reduces the effect of sampling variability, which results in a more precise estimate of the population parameter.\n",

    "However, the effect of sample size on the margin of error is not linear. In fact, the relationship is inverse square root, meaning that a fourfold increase in sample size leads to a twofold decrease in the margin of error. For example, if we double the sample size, the margin of error will be reduced by a factor of √2 or about 1.4.\n",

    "It is important to note that the margin of error is not the same as the sampling error, which refers to the difference between the sample statistic and the true population parameter.
