    "A2. Nominal encoding is a technique used to encode categorical data where each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, in a real-world scenario, we can use nominal encoding to encode the different types of cars available in a car showroom. Suppose we have three types of cars: Sedan, SUV, and Hatchback. We can assign integer values such as 1, 2, and 3 to these categories, respectively.\n",

    "A4. If the categorical data has only five unique values, we can use nominal encoding to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Nominal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category, and this technique works well for small numbers of unique categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. If we were to use nominal encoding to transform two categorical columns, we would create two new columns. Since nominal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category, each column would be replaced with a new column containing integer values.\n",

    "A6. For categorical data containing information about different types of animals, we can use one-hot encoding to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. One-hot encoding creates a new column for each unique category and assigns a binary value to each row indicating the presence or absence of the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "A7. To transform the categorical data into numerical data for the customer churn dataset, we can use one-hot encoding for the gender and contract type columns since they have a small number of unique categories. For the age column, we can use binning to group customers into age ranges. Finally, for the monthly charges and tenure columns, we can leave them as numerical data since they are already in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms."
