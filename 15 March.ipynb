    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or computer programs to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and learning. AI can be classified into different types, such as weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and strong AI, which aims to mimic human intelligence in all aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a chatbot that can hold a conversation with a user and provide helpful responses can be considered an example of weak AI. On the other hand, a general-purpose AI that can perform any cognitive task that a human can, such as understanding language, recognizing images, and making decisions, would be an example of strong AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves using algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. ML algorithms can be categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a spam email filter that uses supervised learning. The filter is trained on a large dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) and learns to identify patterns in the emails that distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. Once the filter is trained, it can be used to automatically classify new emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn representations of data at different levels of abstraction. DL has achieved significant breakthroughs in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and other AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a deep learning model can be trained to recognize handwritten digits. The model consists of multiple layers of neurons, each learning to detect increasingly complex patterns in the input data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to recognize digits in new images with high accuracy, even if the digits are handwritten in different styles or orientations.\n",
