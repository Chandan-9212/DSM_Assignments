The PMF of the die can be defined as follows:\n",

    "The PDF, on the other hand, is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable, which can take on any value in a certain interval. The PDF assigns a probability density to each value of the random variable, and the integral of the PDF over the entire interval is equal to one. For example, consider the height of people in a population. The PDF of the height can be defined as follows:\n",
