    "The advantages of Flask framework are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework that doesn't require particular tools or libraries to get started. It is easy to learn and simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible: Flask provides developers with a lot of flexibility. It allows you to use any database, templating engine, or other third-party libraries that you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to use: Flask has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to get started with web development. It provides an easy-to-use routing system, which allows developers to define URL patterns for their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable: Flask is highly scalable, and it can handle a large number of requests without any performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular: Flask is built using a modular design, which means that you can use only the parts of the framework that you need for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is widely used: Flask is one of the most widely used web frameworks in the Python community, which means that there is a large community of developers who can provide support and share their knowledge.\n",
