    "The GET and POST methods are two common HTTP methods used in web development to communicate between a client and a server.\n",

    "GET Method:\n",
    "The GET method is used to retrieve information from the server. When a client sends a GET request, it includes parameters in the URL. The server processes the request and sends back a response in the form of a resource. This resource can be an HTML page, an image, or any other file type. The GET method is idempotent, which means that multiple identical requests will produce the same result as a single request.\n",
    "For example, when you type a URL into your web browser and press Enter, you are sending a GET request to the server to retrieve the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to the server. Unlike GET requests, POST requests do not include parameters in the URL. Instead, the data is sent in the body of the request. The server processes the request and sends back a response. POST requests are not idempotent, which means that multiple identical requests may produce different results.\n",
    "For example, when you fill out a form on a website and click the submit button, you are sending a POST request to the server with the data from the form.\n",
